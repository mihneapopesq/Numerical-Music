# Numerical-Music

This project introduces you to Audio Signal Processing, providing insight into how software like FL Studio or Ableton works.

## Topics Covered

#### Storing Analog Signals
- Learn how analog signals are converted into digital formats and the differences between stereo and mono sound.

#### Creating Sound with Oscillators
- Explore how oscillators generate waveforms and how they shape artificial sounds.

#### Visualizing Sound
- Understand how to "see" sound using waveform displays and spectrograms.

#### Applying Filters
- Learn how to apply effects and filters to manipulate sound like a professional music producer.


### Key Points (Shortened):
- Analog to Digital Conversion: Involves sampling (measuring at intervals) and quantization (dividing into discrete levels).
Nyquist-Shannon Theorem: Sampling rate ≥ 2x the highest frequency.

- Stereo vs Mono: Stereo has two channels (left/right); mono is a single channel (average of all channels).

- Spectrogram: Visualizes frequency over time; amplitude is shown by color (red = high, blue = low).

- Oscillator: Generates sound waves, with the simplest being a sine wave oscillator (pure single frequency).

- Envelope (ADSR): Describes amplitude changes—Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release.

- Low Pass Filter: Removes high frequencies, allowing lower ones to pass.

- Reverb: Simulates sound reflection in space, often using an impulse response to create depth.
